### Will there be custom themes for planets?
You will be able to customize your planets with different themes. It is most likely going to be custom CSS but it might change in the future.

### How will Valour be monetized?
In the future, Valour will be monetized using a subscription for communities and possibly one for specific users as well.

### How will Valour handle user reports?
Valour will prioritize reports of activity that breaks the law, such as doxxing, illegal material and extortion. Valour will not punish people for being offensive and only assure safety and law.

### I want [insert feature]!
A lot of features that are suggested are already planned to be implemented it is just due to Valour being in it's very early stage means they haven't been coded yet. Some examples of asked for features like this are two factor authentication and password resets. 

However if you do think that a feature that you are suggesting is unique it never hurts to suggest it!

### Will Valour have a Voice Chat?
It is not planned to have a voice chat until a viable product has released and funding has been received.

#### *Why couldn't you just make people host the voice chats locally?*
Local hosting would not be secure for people as the person hosting it could steal their data. Even if it was encrypted, Valour would have to process and proxy it which would cost money.

### What are planets and systems?
Planets are where your community will be on. There will be chat rooms and categories. Systems are an optional collection of planets. They would be primarily used for large communities or with many separate different sub-communities. For example, a nation roleplay where is multiple nations. Each nation would have its planet and they would be all in the one system for their roleplay.

#### *How will Systems and Planets be organized?*
System roles would be applied to every planet within the system. This would also apply the permission the system user has onto the planet and planets would have their roles as well. This means if someone was a system admin they would also be an admin on planets within the system almost acting like planets within a single planet.

### Are we going to have sub-categories?
Yes, you can have as many as you want on your planets.

### How can I set my profile picture?
Currently there is no way to have a profile picture unless done manually by a developer of Valour. However in the future you will be able to do it yourself.
