Subscription period  
-------------------

The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid
Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis
(such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually), depending on the type of
Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.

At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under
the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.

Subscription cancellations  
--------------------------

You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings
page or by contacting the Company. You will not receive a refund for the fees
You already paid for Your current Subscription period and You will be able to
access the Service until the end of Your current Subscription period.

the renewal of Your Subscription with the Application Store.

Billing  
-------

You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information
including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue
an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a
certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing
period as indicated on the invoice.

If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, all billing is
handled by the Application Store and is governed by the Application Store's
own terms and conditions.

The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the

-------

Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the Company on
a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the Company.

If the Subscription has been made through an In-app purchase, the Application
Store's refund policy will apply. If You wish to request a refund, You may do
so by contacting the Application Store directly.

If any In-app Purchase is not successfully downloaded or does not work once it
has been successfully downloaded, we will, after becoming aware of the fault
or being notified to the fault by You, investigate the reason for the fault.
We will act reasonably in deciding whether to provide You with a replacement
In-app Purchase or issue You with a patch to repair the fault. In no event
will We charge You to replace or repair the In-app Purchase. In the unlikely
event that we are unable to replace or repair the relevant In-app Purchase or
are unable to do so within a reasonable period of time and without significant
inconvenience to You, We will authorize the Application Store to refund You an
amount up to the cost of the relevant In-app Purchase. Alternatively, if You
wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application Store
directly.

You acknowledge and agree that all billing and transaction processes are
handled by the Application Store from where you downloaded the Application and
are governed by that Application Store's own terms and conditions.
